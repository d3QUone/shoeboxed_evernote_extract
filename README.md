Python script to extract all Receipts <br>from "Shoeboxed" to "Evernote"
==========================

Here is a basic guide to complete job using this script.

1) You have to download Python 2.7.8 from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Open and setup package.

2) Now you have to install an installer of additional libraries named "pip". Download the following file: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
(for example do Control+Click on the page and choose «save page as», option format must be «program code» )

Run «Terminal» app (if you are on Mac) and do the same like me in the following video (better download, 130 mb)  https://yadi.sk/d/LOAvFJtocGzwG
Comments: 
cd - moves you to the directory of file 
pwd - allow you to check and sure that you are not mistaken
sudo - installation under administration, need your password 

3) Now install 2 packages from Terminal:<br>
sudo pip requests<br>
sudo pip evernote<br>

4) Download script and files, open script in Python IDE and press fn+F5 to run them 
You’ll get interactive instructions in the script output. Follow them you will get all data to authorize.
